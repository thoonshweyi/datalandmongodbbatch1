🔧 A software component that allows the operating system or an app to communicate with hardware.
✅ In detail:
A driver (or device driver) is not part of the app itself, but may be required for the app to work properly, especially when:

The app depends on specific hardware (e.g. printer, scanner, graphics card, sound card).

The hardware needs instructions to function with the operating system (Windows, Linux, etc.).

💡 Example:
If you install a photo editing app that uses GPU acceleration, it may require a graphics driver.

If you're installing a printer management app, it may ask you to install a printer driver.

In mobile phones, apps like camera enhancers may depend on camera drivers that come with the phone’s firmware.

🧠 Think of it like this:
A driver is like a translator between the hardware and the software (including apps). Without it, they can’t understand each other.

📝 In Summary:
Term	Meaning in App Installation
Driver	Software that lets the app or OS talk to hardware correctly.
Needed when?	The app uses hardware like printer, scanner, GPU, etc.
